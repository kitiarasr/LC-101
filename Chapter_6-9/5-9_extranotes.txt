//The whole string is considered, it doesnt just stop

print("da" < "db")  True


print("da" == "db") d's are compared, condition is true, so then a and bs are compared,
causing condition to go false
print("da" < "dA")  False, because d is not less than d
print("da" < "Da") False, second letters aren't checked
print("daA" < "dAa") keeps checking letters until flagged false.

It's like it ignores if its equal, and if condition is met ,

lowercase = 96
capital = 65


python rocks
print(s[2] + s[-5])

#-5 is "s" to "k" to "c" to "o" to "r"

list = "hello world"
print(list[-1::-1])

Quick notes for colors:
Close we get to 0, the darker color gets, all the way to black.
To 255 is lightest. If RGB are all 255, we get white
