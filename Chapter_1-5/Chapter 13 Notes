Shallow comparison vs deep comparison
Sometimes the rules change with shallow and deep comparison.
We are not always gonna be comparing points to each other. Sometimes
the contents the pointers point to are compared. Check this out

Here I create two instances and of course the pointers are not he same, resulting in false
p = Point(4, 2)
s = Point(4, 2)
print("== on Points returns", p == s)  # by default, == does a shallow equality test here

Here I have two lists with the same values, and the == in this case compares the contents that
a and b POINT to, instead of a and be themselves. So returns true.
a = [2, 3]
b = [2, 3]
print("== on lists returns",  a == b)  # by default, == does a deep equality test on lists
