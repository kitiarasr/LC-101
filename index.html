<!--An inline thing can be closed with a carrot tag without the ending / thing.-->
<!--always make sure to do /css/file instead of css/file because having the absolute path

./ means relative path, while / means absolute path. the ../ thing is supposed to be used
if you want to refer to a folder that encompasses where your target stuff is. So you're
referring to your outside folder (which contains the folder that contains your item) then you use the ../-->
