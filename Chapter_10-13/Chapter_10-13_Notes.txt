Chapter 10

Collection data types: strings and lists
can use + for strings

alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
alist[1:2] = ['x', 'y','z',100]
print(alist)

list3 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
list3[1] = ['x', 'y','z',100]
print(list3)   #this line actually adds the entire list itself to the list, unlike the other ones

If you add a :, the stuff you add to a list is singular items, but without the : ([4], then whole
list is added)
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
list2[1:3] = ['x', 'y','z',100]
print(list2)


alist = [a, b, f]
alist[1:1] = [b, c]
print(alist)

alist2 = [a, d, f]
alist[1:0] = [b,c]
print(alist)   # these two samples prints the same, [a,b,c,d,f]


#below we try to add a single 1 to list, but this results in an error. only works
if you are not using :. The item must be "iterable" in order to be assigned with
range technique (:).

alist = ["Happy", "Friday"]
alist[1] = 1
print(alist)

alist = ["Happy", "Friday"]
alist[1:1] = "lauchcode"
print(alist)

alist = ["Happy", "Friday"]
alist[1:1] = 5  #error because you only have 1 item, you need to have a list of multiple items
print(alist)
